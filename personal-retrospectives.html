    <p>For a little over a year, I have set aside some time on Friday of each week to run a personal retrospective in a similar vein to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/retrospective-most-important-agile-ceremony-sam-perera-he-him-/">Agile ceremony</a> (I actually have a recurring appointment in my Outlook for this).
Essentially I reflect on the past week and write down what went well and areas to improve and keep the running log in a <code>retrospectives</code> file on my computer.
This was especially useful when starting a new job as it helped not only to allow me to see how I was progressing but also to keep me focused on working toward an improved future.</p>
<p>One of the other great benefits has been when evaluation season comes around.
The past few companies I have worked for have had a review cycle that starts with a self-evaluation, and I always found writing one both tedious and difficult.
I would rely only on memory (maybe supplemented with records of where I had charged time or similar heuristics) which meant I had forgotten many events toward the beginning or even the middle of the review period.
This reflects an all-too-common complaint about evaluations: events nearer to the end of the period have disproportionately increased significance.
Thus a year-end review becomes a summary of the previous month - not helpful.
Keeping a weekly retrospective helps to guard against this by saving those noteworthy events from the entire period and telling a story of progress and professional development (hopefully!).</p>
<p>Needless to say, these retros makes it very easy for me to take stock of many of the items I would like to reflect in my self-evaluation.
The other key tool is a simple to-do list manager like <a href="https://github.com/jameselliothart/pstodo">pstodo</a> (see the Motivation in the introductory Todo kata <a href="todo-kata-introduction">post</a>) which helps me have more productive retrospectives (both personal and with the team) and further fill in any gaps in my self-eval.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>Carve out time at the end of each week to have a personal retrospective and log:<ul>
<li>What went well</li>
<li>Areas to improve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reference your retrospectives log when writing self-evaluations</li>
<li>Bonus: having a to-do list manager helps with both retros and evals</li>
</ol>
