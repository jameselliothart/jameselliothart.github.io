    <h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to the third and final post in the Maps of DevOps series!</p>
<h2>A Return to the Beginning</h2>
<p>We noted at the beginning that Development and Operations are composed of smaller units just as the business was composed of Dev and Ops.
Now consider mailing letters as a full-scale business enterprise: instead of one Folder, there is a team of Folders reporting to a team lead with each department composed of many teams.</p>
<p>The question we ask now is: Who has the most information about what works well and what doesn't on the current folding techniques?
The answer, of course, is the people doing the folding - the folders themselves.
That is not really the question.
The question is who know <em>what the process actually is in practice</em> as opposed to simply what someone <em>imagines</em> it to be.
People doing the work may have a blind spot in thinking something works well that doesn't at all (they don't know of another way).
If you want to find out what the process is, you have to ask the people doing the processing.
Gather their ideas for improvement, but this is also a chance for more senior leaders to give perspective and counsel.</p>
<h2>The Third Way: Continuous Learning</h2>
<p><img alt="The Third Way" src="https://jameselliothart.github.io/images/maps-of-devops-third/TheThirdWay.png"></p>
<p>What we derive from this is that the fractal nature of the original map means that the first two ways (Systems Thinking and Amplify Feedback Loops) must be applied down the whole chain.
What is true at one level of analysis (business) is true at all others (department and individual).
That is to say, each individual should try to improve their own workflow and gather feedback on what is working and what is not.
If everyone does just a little and shares it, it doesn't take long for those gains to compound.
What does it look like for an individual to embody Systems Thinking?
Fine-tuning their workflow.
Avoiding rework.
Automating repetitive or cumbersome tasks.
What does it look like for an individual to Amplify Feedback Loops?
Share that knowledge with others.
See if it works for them, what suggestions they have, what they've done.
The Third Way is the recognition that if this happens at every level, a culture of continuous learning and improvement has developed.
This can't be mandated from the top down, it must be encouraged from the ground up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A system is no better than its sensory organs
-John Gall, <em>Systemantics</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the sensory organs of an organization are the people living and working in it.
Thus each individual should be encouraged to make their own hypotheses, run experiments, and share the outcomes with others.</p>
<p>Internal wiki pages such as can be created with <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> and <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration">SharePoint</a>, collaboration apps like <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Microsoft Teams</a>, and source code open to the company all help to facilitate this.</p>
<p>That said, not every change can be driven at the individual level - this is the important role that leadership serves in having a broader perspective.
However, that perspective must be kept healthy and up-to-date.
This is the reason for the authors' insistence in <em>Leading the Transformation</em> that executives "walk the floor" to see day-to-day operations first-hand.</p>
<p>Without constant effort, systems fall apart of their own accord.
This is the unavoidable and continual march of entropic decay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work
-Gene Kim, <em>The Phoenix Project</em></p>
