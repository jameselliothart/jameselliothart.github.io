I recently had the pleasure of appearing on episode 56 of Pluralsight's [All Hands on Tech](https://www.pluralsight.com/resource-center/podcasts) podcast!
I have used Pluralsight through my workplace over the last few years and found it to be a great learning resource, so it was really an honor to be invited to speak with them about the platform and to share my experience with continual learning and career advancement.

In the episode, we discuss among other things how Pluralsight has influenced my career and specific features of the platform I've found useful.
I give some advice for staying committed to acquiring new skills and even name a few of my favorite Pluralsight authors.
