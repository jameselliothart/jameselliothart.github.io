## Motivation

>People don't have ideas. Ideas have people.  
-Carl Jung

This post marks the beginning of a multi-part series
explaining the ideas of DevOps (that is, Development Operations).
The target audience is primarily those
unfamiliar with DevOps, and it is meant to
be friendly even to those without a technical background who seek to
understand the principles behind what has become something of a tech
buzzword. Perhaps even those already initiated may find a nice
insight or two.

I first encountered the principles of DevOps in a book called
_Leading the Transformation_<sup>1</sup> some years ago and have since
become rather passionate about the topic.
Sadly over that same period, I have also
seen its impenetrability to those
not expressly interested in seeking it out and have been
disheartened by the ease with which it is misunderstood.

Traditional introductions to DevOps typically begin with an
analogy to the Lean manufacturing movement of the 1980's, and
I have always found that somewhat
unsatisfying. This approach has the benefit of rooting
DevOps in a mature framework, but it runs the risk of
explaining a new concept in terms of another, equally foreign one.

Owing to a background in mathematics, I have long been interested in
the ways in which ideas or methods generalize. Thus
the congruence between these disparate fields suggested to me
an underlying idea common to both.

As I thought about these ideas, I noticed a similarity between
the figures used to express [The Three Ways of DevOps][ThreeWays]
<sup>2</sup> and those used to
describe the phenomenological landscape of human motivation in
_Maps of Meaning_<sup>3</sup> . Thus the title of this series, _Maps of DevOps_,
is a play on that book's title. This leads directly to my approach which
perhaps predictably is to show how the principles of DevOps can be
derived from the ideas presented there.

## Approach

>There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy  
-Friedrich Nietzsche, _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_

At a high level, my
goal is to marry Gene Kim's Three Ways of DevOps (expressed succinctly
in his post on [The Three Ways][ThreeWays] and elaborated in detail in
_The DevOps Handbook_<sup>4</sup>) with some of the
ideas underlying the book _Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of
Belief_. More precisely, I will attempt to show that DevOps can
naturally be understood within that framework.

I believe this approach makes these principles more
widely applicable as it emphasizes that DevOps is an idea, a culture,
a pattern of existence and not a particular set of tools and
buzzwords.

I hope you will join me on this journey.

## Figures

The following are figures from _Maps of Meaning_ juxtaposed with Gene
Kim's diagrammatic representations of The Three Ways of DevOps.
