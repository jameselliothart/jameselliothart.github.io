## Welcome!

I created this blog to serve as an outlet for ideas I had around DevOps, software development, and IT generally.
I will also write about things I have learned or am working on in order to reinforce those lessons and serve as a reference in the future.
By making it public, it is my hope that others may find something useful as well.

This blog is hosted as a GitHub Page and created with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).
The articles below were instrumental in making this possible:

- [Run your blog on GitHub Pages with Python](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python)
- [How to Create Your First Static Site with Pelican and Jinja2](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/generating-static-websites-pelican-jinja2-markdown.html)
