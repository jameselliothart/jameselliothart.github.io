I have used Pluralsight through my workplace over the last few years and found it to be a great learning resource, so it was really an honor to be invited to speak with them about the platform and to share my experience with continual learning and career advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the episode, we discuss among other things how Pluralsight has influenced my career and specific features of the platform I've found useful.
I give some advice for staying committed to acquiring new skills and even name a few of my favorite Pluralsight authors.&lt;/p&gt;
