# GitHub Page

This repo feeds into the associated GitHub page [jameselliothart.github.io](https://jameselliothart.github.io).
The `content` branch contains source files while the GitHub page is served out of `master` and is generated
through pelican and ghp-import.

The articles below were instrumental in this implementation:

* [Run your blog on GitHub Pages with Python](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python)
* [How to Create Your First Static Site with Pelican and Jinja2](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/generating-static-websites-pelican-jinja2-markdown.html)
